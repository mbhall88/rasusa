## Motivation

I couldn't find a tool for subsampling reads that met my requirements. All the
strategies I could find fell short as they either just wanted a number or percentage of
reads to subsample to or, if they did subsample to a coverage, they assume all reads are
the same size (i.e Illumina). As I mostly work with long-read data this posed a problem
if I wanted to subsample a file to certain coverage, as length of reads was never taken
into account. `rasusa` addresses this shortcoming.

A workaround I had been using for a while was using [`filtlong`][filtlong]. It was
simple enough, I just figure out the number of bases I need to achieve a (theoretical)
coverage for my sample. Say I have a fastq from an _E. coli_ sample with 5 million reads
and I want to subset it to 50x coverage. I just need to multiply the expected size of
the sample's genome, 4.6 million base pairs, by the coverage I want and I have my target
bases - 230 million base pairs. In `filtlong`, I can do the following

```sh
target=230000000
filtlong --target_bases "$target" reads.fq > reads.50x.fq
```

However, this is technically not the intended function of `filtlong`; it's a quality
filtering tool. What you get in the end is a subset of the ["highest scoring"][score]
reads at a (theoretical) coverage of 50x. Depending on your circumstances, this might be
what you want. However, you bias yourself towards the best/longest reads in the dataset
\- not a fair representation of your dataset as a whole. There is also the possibility
of favouring regions of the genome that produce longer/higher quality reads. [De Maio
_et al._][mgen-ref] even found that by randomly subsampling nanopore reads you achieve
_better_ genome assemblies than if you had filtered.

So, depending on your circumstances, an unbiased subsample of your reads might be what
you need. And if this is the case, `rasusa` has you covered.

## Install

Some of these installation options require the [`rust` toolchain][rust], which is
extremely easy to set up. However, if you do not wish to install `rust` then there are a
number of options available.

### `cargo`

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rasusa.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/rasusa)

Prerequisite: [`rust` toolchain][rust] (min. v1.53.0)

```sh
cargo install rasusa
```

Prerequisite: [`docker`][docker]

```sh
docker pull quay.io/mbhall88/rasusa
docker run quay.io/mbhall88/rasusa rasusa --help
```

You can find all the available tags on the [quay.io repository][quay.io]. Note: versions
prior to 0.4.0 were housed on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mbhall88/rasusa).

### `homebrew`

Prerequisite: [`homebrew`][homebrew]

The `homebrew` installation is done via the [homebrew-bio tap][brew-tap].

```sh
brew tap brewsci/bio
brew install rasusa
```

or

```sh
brew install brewsci/bio/rasusa
```

### Release binaries

**tl;dr**: Run the following snippet to download the binary for your system to the
current directory and show the help menu.

```shell
OS=$(uname -s)                                                                                                       
if [ "$OS" = "Linux" ]; then                                                                                         
    triple="x86_64-unknown-linux-musl"                                                                              
elif [ "$OS" = "Darwin" ]; then                                                                                        
    triple="x86_64-apple-darwin"                                                         
else                                                      
    echo "ERROR: $OS not a recognised operating system"
fi              
if [ -n "$triple" ]; then   
    URL="https://github.com/mbhall88/rasusa/releases/download/0.5.0/rasusa-0.5.0-${triple}.tar.gz"
    wget "$URL" -O - | tar -xzf -
    ./rasusa --help             
fi
```

These binaries _do not_ require that you have the `rust` toolchain installed.

Currently, there are two pre-compiled binaries available:
- Linux kernel `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` (works on most Linux distributions I tested)
- OSX kernel `x86_64-apple-darwin` (works for any post-2007 Mac)

An example of downloading one of these binaries using `wget`

```sh
URL="https://github.com/mbhall88/rasusa/releases/download/0.5.0/rasusa-0.5.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz"
wget "$URL" -O - | tar -xzf -
./rasusa --help
```

If these binaries do not work on your system please raise an issue and I will
potentially add some additional [target triples][triples].

### Build locally

Prerequisite: [`rust` toolchain][rust]

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mbhall88/rasusa.git
cd rasusa
cargo build --release
target/release/rasusa --help
# if you want to check everything is working ok
cargo test --all
```

## Usage

### Basic usage

```
rasusa --input in.fq --coverage 30 --genome-size 4.6mb
```

The above command will output the subsampled file to `stdout`.

Or, if you have paired Illumina

```
rasusa -i r1.fq -i r2.fq --coverage 30 --genome-size 4g -o out.r1.fq -o out.r2.fq
```

For more details on the above options, and additional options, see below.

### Required parameters

There are three required options to run `rasusa`.

#### Input

##### `-i`, `--input`

This option specifies the file(s) containing the reads you would like to subsample. The
file(s) must be valid fasta or fastq format and can be compressed (with a tool such as
`gzip`).  
Illumina paired files can be passed in two ways.
1. Using `--input` twice `-i r1.fq -i r2.fq`
2. Using `--input` once, but passing both files immediately after `-i r1.fq r2.fq`

> Bash wizard tip 🧙: Let globs do the work for you `-i r*.fq`

#### Coverage

##### `-c`, `--coverage`

> Not required if [`--bases`](#target-number-of-bases) is present

This option is used to determine the minimum coverage to subsample the reads to. It can
be specified as an integer (100), a decimal/float (100.7), or either of the previous
suffixed with an 'x' (100x).

_**Note**: Due to the method for determining how many bases are required to achieve the
desired coverage, the actual coverage, in the end, could be slightly higher than
requested. For example, if the last included read is very long. The log messages should
inform you of the actual coverage in the end._

#### Genome size

##### `-g`, `--genome-size`

> Not required if [`--bases`](#target-number-of-bases) is present

The genome size of the input is also required. It is used to determine how many bases
are necessary to achieve the desired coverage. This can, of course, be as precise or
rough as you like.  
Genome size can be passed in many ways. As a plain old integer (1600), or with a metric
suffix (1.6kb). All metric suffixes can have an optional 'b' suffix and be lower, upper,
or mixed case. So 'Kb', 'kb' and 'k' would all be inferred as 'kilo'. Valid metric
suffixes include:

- Base (b) - multiplies by 1
- Kilo (k) - multiplies by 1,000
- Mega (m) - multiplies by 1,000,000
- Giga (g) - multiplies by 1,000,000,000
- Tera (t) - multiplies by 1,000,000,000,000

### Optional parameters

#### Output

##### `-o`, `--output`

NOTE: This parameter is required if passing paired Illumina data.

By default, `rasusa` will output the subsampled file to `stdout` (if one file is given).
If you would prefer to specify an output file path, then use this option.

Output for Illumina paired files can be specified in the same manner as
[`--input`](#input)
1. Using `--output` twice `-o out.r1.fq -o out.r2.fq`
2. Using `--output` once, but passing both files immediately after `-o out.r1.fq
   out.r2.fq`

The ordering of the output files is assumed to be the same as the input.  
_Note: The output will always be in the same format as the input. You cannot pass fastq
as input and ask for fasta as output._

`rasusa` will also attempt to automatically infer whether comression of the output
file(s) is required. It does this by detecting any of the supported extensions:
- `.gz`: will compress the output with [`gzip`][gzip]
- `.bz` or `.bz2`: will compress the output with [`bzip2`][bzip]
- `.lzma`: will compress the output with the [`xz`][xz] LZMA algorithm

[gzip]: http://www.gzip.org/
[bzip]: https://sourceware.org/bzip2/
[xz]: https://tukaani.org/xz/

#### Output compression format

##### `-O`, `--output-type`

Use this option to manually set the compression algoritm to use for the output file(s).
It will override any format automatically detected from the output path.

Valid options are:
- `g`: [`gzip`][gzip]
- `b`: [`bzip2`][bzip]
- `l`: [`xz`][xz] LZMA algorithm
- `u`: no compression

*Note: these options are case insensitive.*

#### Compresion level

##### `-l`, `--compress-level`

Compression level to use if compressing the output. 1 is for fastest/least compression
and 9 is for slowest/best. By default this is set to 6, which is also the default for
most compression programs.

#### Target number of bases

##### `-b`, `--bases`

Explicitly set the number of bases required in the subsample. This option takes the
number in the same format as [genome size](#genome-size).

*Note: if this option is given, genome size and coverage are not required, or ignored if
they are provided.*

#### Random seed

##### `-s`, `--seed`

This option allows you to specify the [random seed][seed] used by the random subsampler.
By explicitly setting this parameter, you make the subsample for the input reproducible.
The seed is an integer, and by default it is not set, meaning the operating system will
seed the random subsampler. You should only pass this parameter if you are likely to
want to subsample the same input file again in the future and want the same subset of
reads.

#### Verbosity

##### `-v`

Adding this optional flag will make the logging more verbose. By default, logging will
produce messages considered "info" or above (see [here][log-lvl] for more details). If
verbosity is switched on, you will additionally get "debug" level logging messages.

### Full usage

```text
$ rasusa --help

rasusa 0.5.0
Randomly subsample reads to a specified coverage.

USAGE:
    rasusa [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --bases <bases> --coverage <FLOAT> --genome-size <genome-size> --input <input>...

FLAGS:
    -h, --help
            Prints help information

            Prints version information

    -v
            Switch on verbosity.


OPTIONS:
    -b, --bases <bases>
            Explicitly set the number of bases required e.g., 4.3kb, 7Tb, 9000, 4.1MB

            If this option is given, --coverage and --genome-size are ignored
    -l, --compress-level <1-9>
            Compression level to use if compressing output [default: 6]

    -c, --coverage <FLOAT>
            The desired coverage to sub-sample the reads to

            If --bases is not provided, this option and --genome-size are required
    -g, --genome-size <genome-size>
            Genome size to calculate coverage with respect to. e.g., 4.3kb, 7Tb, 9000, 4.1MB

            If --bases is not provided, this option and --coverage are required
    -i, --input <input>...
            The fast{a,q} file(s) to subsample.

            For paired Illumina you may either pass this flag twice `-i r1.fq -i r2.fq` or give two files consecutively
            `-i r1.fq r2.fq`.
    -o, --output <output>...
            Output filepath(s); stdout if not present.

            For paired Illumina you may either pass this flag twice `-o o1.fq -o o2.fq` or give two files consecutively
            `-o o1.fq o2.fq`. NOTE: The order of the pairs is assumed to be the same as that given for --input. This
            option is required for paired input.
    -O, --output-type <u|b|g|l>
            u: uncompressed; b: Bzip2; g: Gzip; l: Lzma

            Rasusa will attempt to infer the output compression format automatically from the filename extension. This
            option is used to override that. If writing to stdout, the default is uncompressed
    -s, --seed <INT>
            Random seed to use..
```

### Snakemake

If you want to use `rasusa` in a [`snakemake`][snakemake] pipeline, it is advised to use
the [wrapper][wrapper].

```py
rule subsample:
    input:
        r1="{sample}.r1.fq",
        r2="{sample}.r2.fq",
    output:
        r1="{sample}.subsampled.r1.fq",
        r2="{sample}.subsampled.r2.fq",
    params:
        options="--seed 15",  # optional
        genome_size="3mb",  # required
        coverage=20,  # required
    log:
        "logs/subsample/{sample}.log",
    wrapper:
        "0.70.0/bio/rasusa"
```

*See the [latest wrapper][wrapper] documentation for the most up-to-date version
number.*

## Benchmark

> “Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.”  
> ― Anthony G. Oettinger

The real question is: will `rasusa` just needlessly eat away at your precious time on
earth?

To do this benchmark, I am going to use [hyperfine][hyperfine].

The data I used comes from

> [Bainomugisa, Arnold, et al. "A complete high-quality MinION nanopore assembly of an
> extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing lineage strain
> identifies novel variation in repetitive PE/PPE gene regions." Microbial genomics 4.7
> (2018).][1]

### Single long read input

Download and rename the fastq

```shell
URL="ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR649/008/SRR6490088/SRR6490088_1.fastq.gz"
wget "$URL" -O - | gzip -d -c > tb.fq
```

The file size is 2.9G, and it has 379,547 reads.  
We benchmark against `filtlong` using the same strategy outlined in
[Motivation](#motivation).

```shell
TB_GENOME_SIZE=4411532
COVG=50
TARGET_BASES=$(( TB_GENOME_SIZE * COVG ))
FILTLONG_CMD="filtlong --target_bases $TARGET_BASES tb.fq"
RASUSA_CMD="rasusa -i tb.fq -c $COVG -g $TB_GENOME_SIZE -s 1"
hyperfine --warmup 3 --runs 10 --export-markdown results-single.md \
     "$FILTLONG_CMD" "$RASUSA_CMD" 
```

#### Results

| Command                                   |       Mean [s] | Min [s] | Max [s] |     Relative |
|:------------------------------------------|---------------:|--------:|--------:|-------------:|
| `filtlong --target_bases 220576600 tb.fq` | 21.685 ± 0.055 |  21.622 |  21.787 | 21.77 ± 0.29 |
| `rasusa -i tb.fq -c 50 -g 4411532 -s 1`   | 0.996 ±  0.013 |   0.983 |   1.023 |         1.00 |

**Summary**: `rasusa` ran 21.77 ± 0.29 times faster than `filtlong`.

### Paired-end input

Download and then deinterleave the fastq with [`pyfastaq`][pyfastaq]

```shell
URL="ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR648/008/SRR6488968/SRR6488968.fastq.gz"
wget "$URL" -O - | gzip -d -c - | fastaq deinterleave - r1.fq r2.fq
```

Each file's size is 179M and has 283,590 reads.  
For this benchmark, we will use [`seqtk`][seqtk]. As `seqtk` requires a fixed number of
reads to subsample to, I ran `rasusa` initially and got the number of reads it was using
for its subsample. We will also test `seqtk`'s 2-pass mode as this is analogous to
`rasusa`.  
We use a lower coverage for the Illumina as the samples only have ~38x coverage.

```shell
TB_GENOME_SIZE=4411532
COVG=20
NUM_READS=147052
SEQTK_CMD_1="seqtk sample -s 1 r1.fq $NUM_READS > /tmp/r1.fq; seqtk sample -s 1 r2.fq $NUM_READS > /tmp/r2.fq;"
SEQTK_CMD_2="seqtk sample -2 -s 1 r1.fq $NUM_READS > /tmp/r1.fq; seqtk sample -2 -s 1 r2.fq $NUM_READS > /tmp/r2.fq;"
RASUSA_CMD="rasusa -i r1.fq r2.fq -c $COVG -g $TB_GENOME_SIZE -s 1 -o /tmp/r1.fq -o /tmp/r2.fq"
hyperfine --warmup 5 --runs 20 --export-markdown results-paired.md \
     "$SEQTK_CMD_1" "$SEQTK_CMD_2" "$RASUSA_CMD"
```

#### Results

| Command                                                                                           |    Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] |    Relative |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------:|---------:|---------:|------------:|
| `seqtk sample -s 1 r1.fq 147052 > /tmp/r1.fq; seqtk sample -s 1 r2.fq 147052 > /tmp/r2.fq;`       | 693.8 ± 17.4 |    678.8 |    780.5 | 1.21 ± 0.19 |
| `seqtk sample -2 -s 1 r1.fq 147052 > /tmp/r1.fq; seqtk sample -2 -s 1 r2.fq 147052 > /tmp/r2.fq;` | 739.5 ± 28.4 |    695.6 |    811.8 | 1.29 ± 0.20 |
| `./rasusa -i r1.fq r2.fq -c 20 -g 4411532 -s 1 -o /tmp/r1.fq -o /tmp/r2.fq`                       | 574.7 ± 88.1 |    432.3 |    784.4 |        1.00 |

**Summary**: `rasusa` ran 1.21 times faster than `seqtk` (1-pass) and 1.29 times faster
than `seqtk` (2-pass)

So, `rasusa` is faster than `seqtk` but doesn't require a fixed number of reads -
allowing you to avoid doing maths to determine how many reads you need to downsample to
a specific coverage. 🤓

## Contributing

If you would like to help improve `rasusa` you are very welcome!

For changes to be accepted, they must pass the CI and coverage checks. These include:

- Code is formatted with `rustfmt`. This can be done by running `cargo fmt` in the
  project directory.
- There are no compiler errors/warnings. You can check this by running `cargo clippy
  --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- Code coverage has not reduced. If you want to check coverage before pushing changes, I
  use [`kcov`][kcov].

## Citing

If you use `rasusa` in your research, it would be very much appreciated if you could
cite it.
